It involves implementing engineering principles to software development to create efficient programs
It ensures software meets user needs and sustainable
High Level Programming: It makes programming more accessible and reduce the need for machine code.Structured Programming: Introduced fundamental syntax to make programs more readable. Agile Methods: It emphasizes flexibility and iterative developments
Waterfall is a linear approach where a phase must be finished before the next begins, example; buildiing a bridge. Agile is an iterative approach where solutions are through collaboration,example;software for startup
Software developer writes and maintains code. Quality Assurance Engineer tests the software to ensure it is bug free. Project manager oversees the project and coordinates the team
IDEs provide a comprehensive features for writing and debugging code. VCS enable collaboration and allow developers to revert to previous versions of code
Debugging complex issue, it can be curbed by using breaking down problems and using debugging tools.Keeping Up with Technology: Continuous learning and participation in community forums
Unit: Tests individual components. Integration Testing: Tests how different components work together. System Testing: Tests the complete system. Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user requirements.
Prompt Engineering involves crafting inputs to get the desired output from AI models. It is important because clear prompts lead to more accurate responses from AI, improving accuracy.
Vague Prompt: Tell about software. Improved Prompt: Explain the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Why Improved?: The improved prompt is specific about the information needed, making it easier for the AI to provide a relevant response.
